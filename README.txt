The "Cosmetic Harmfulness Checker" project integrates cutting-edge technologies like computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), and Chatbot functionality 
to empower consumers in assessing the safety of cosmetic products. Through object detection, users can scan product labels, which are then analyzed to determine 
potential harmful ingredients using NLP-powered queries. The project's goal is to promote transparency, educate consumers about ingredient safety, and foster a culture
of health consciousness within the cosmetics industry. With a user-friendly interface and robust security measures, the project aims to provide a reliable tool for 
making informed decisions about cosmetic products.
